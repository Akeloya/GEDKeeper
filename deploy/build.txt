How to build `GEDKeeper' with make

Windows

Having the following toolchains is a prerequisite for building
`GEDKeeper' on Windows host:

  1. MSYS2/MINGW shell.
     MAY BE it's enough to have Windows 10's (Ubuntu's) BASH shell. I
     didn't test that.

  2. GNU make package installed in the shell from above.

To begin change directory to one, where GEDKeeper project is located.

$ /d/vsp/gedkeeper

Then simply run 'make' utility:

$ make

Default target ('all') builds and installs all binaries (GEDKeeper
itself and all available plug-ins).

All subprojects also have their makefiles. But those makefiles' default
target ('all') only builds a release and doesn't install it. Use
'install' goal to install specific project's binaries.

The following variables are supported by all makefiles:

  * `hardwareplatform`
    Target hardware platform. Possible values are `any`, `x86-64` and
    `x86`. `any` is default.

  * `softwareplatform`
    Target software implementation on the hardware platform. Possible
    values are `windows` and `linux`. `windows` is default.

  * `releasetype`
    Release type. Possible values are `debug` and `release`. `release`
    is default.

  * `dotnet`
    Determines .NET framework to use. Possible values are `dotnet20`
    and `dotnet46`. `dotnet20` is default.

Therefore, the following calls are equivalent:

$ make
$ make hardwareplatform=any softwareplatform=windows
  releasetype=release dotnet=dotnet20

Linux

Sorry, not yet implemented.
