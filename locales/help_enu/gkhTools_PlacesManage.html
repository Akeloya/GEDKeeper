<h1>Tools: geographical locations management</h1>
<p>This tool puts in order all references to geographical locations in
a large database: adds to a reference index, reduces different forms to
a single one, assign coordinates and so on.</p>
<p>The tool scans entire database and create a list of all locations
mentioned in events and facts. Then it orders the list, and calculates
number of references to each location. If a location already has an
entry in the reference index, such location gets &#39;[*]&#39; sign in its
name.</p>
<p>To create new entry in the reference index, you should select a
location without &#39;[*]&#39; sign and double click it. Standard
dialog appears where you select an entry from an index (in case this
location already exists but has different name) or dialog where add new
location. After you have completed entering data, all references to the
location will be modified according to the reference index.</p>
