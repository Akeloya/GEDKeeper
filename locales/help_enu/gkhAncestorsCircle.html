<h1>Ancestors circle</h1>
<p><em>Ancestors circle</em> is a special-purpose diagram that shows all ancestors of selected person as sectors of concentric circles. Settings for
this diagram are available at &quot;<a href="gkhOptions.html#circle">Diagrams\Ancestors circle</a>&quot; tab in &quot;Options&quot window. You can open &quot;Options&quot dialog using
&quot;Edit\Options...&quot; menu. Settings on the specified tab allows you to set up the diagram appearance.</p>
<p>To generate &quot;Ancestors circle&quot; diagram select a target entry in the persons list and then use &quot;Ancestors circle&quot; item in &quot;Pedigree&quot; menu.</p>
<p>The following actions are available while you are viewing the diagram:
<ul>
<li><kbd>[ Left ]</kbd> key updates diagram of father of selected person,</li>
<li><kbd>[ Right ]</kbd> key updates diagram of mother of selected person,</li>
<li><kbd>[ Up ]</kbd> key increases the number of displayed generations,</li>
<li><kbd>[ Down ]</kbd> key decreases the number of displayed generations,</li>
<li><kbd>[ Backspace ]</kbd> key returns to a previous person,</li>
<li>click a sector to update diagram of selected person,</li>
<li>doule click outside the diagram to change the current view mode to ancestors compositional analysis mode or revert the current mode back.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The diagram always shows fixed number of ancestral generations (eight generations).</p>
<p>If you have changed the central person clicking a sector of the diagram, you can use <img src="images/iLeft1.gif" align="absmiddle"> and
<img src="images/iRight1.gif" align="absmiddle"> buttons to switch to a previous or next person.</p>
<p>There is an additional ancestors compositional analysis mode available in "Ancestors circle" diagram: you can double click outside the diagram to conduct
ancestor duplication analysis. This analysis changes the diagram as follow: all unique, non-duplicated ancestors have chlorine color, while all ancestors
having two or more occurrence have different color (each duplicating ancestor has its own color). This allows you to evaluate genetic variety of ancestors
more clearly.</p>
