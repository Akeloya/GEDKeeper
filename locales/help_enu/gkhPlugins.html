<h1>Plug-ins</h1>

<p>There are two types of extensions available for GEDKeeper: Lua scripts and plug-ins written in C# or VB.NET.</p>

<p>The following are main reasons to extend an application with plug-in units:</p>

<ul>
<li>User wants to add new functions to application without having to rebuild source code and deploy new release;</li>
<li>User wants to add new functions to application but does not have necessary source code.</li>
</ul>

<p>To create plug-ins, you must use GKCore common library of application's core.</p>
