<h1>Filtering person records</h1>
<p>You use filtering to restrict number of persons you see at once.
Database size grows eventually and one day you will find it very
difficult to find a person you need. Here filters come in handy.</p>
<p>To set up the filters you use <img src="images/iFilter.gif"
align="absmiddle"> toolbar's button, or &quot;Edit\Filter&quot; menu,
or use [Ctrl + F] hot key.</p>
<p>There are two types of filters: standard and additional specific
filters. Standard filters are used for any type of records in database;
it is available on the &quot;Fields filter&quot; tab in filtering
dialog. Additional specific filters are used for person records only
and are available on the &quot;Specific filter&quot; tab, when you are
filtering already opened person list.</p>
<p>Fields filter works identically on any person records. User selects
a target field (a column in the database's list) on which user is about
to apply the filter, add filter condition and value. User can apply
several selection criterions when it is necessary.</p>
<p>For example, you want to select all men with Ivanov-like last name,
who lived in Samara. To do this, open filtering dialog, go to the
filter's first row and select &quot;Full name&quot; value in the
&quotField&quot; drop-down list. Set condition to &quot;Contains&quot;,
and value to &quot;Ivanov&quot;. Then go to the next filter's row and
set field to &quot;Residence&quot;, condition to &quot;Contains&quot;,
and value to &quot;Samara&quot;.</p>
<p>Specific filtration is used to improve performance and work
efficiency while handling person records. Such filter has the following
selection criterions: sex, is a man alive, patriarch's bookmarks, all
name parts, residence and events, and also groups and sources. There
are <a href="gkhMasks.html">masks</a> available when one is filtering
by name, life events and residence.</p>
<p>When processing person records, user can use simple filters along
with additional specific filters.</p>
