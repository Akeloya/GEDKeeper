<h1>Event</h1>
<p>There are two main record types in a genealogical database: events
and facts. An event designates a milestone in person or family life,
therefore an event can be attached to a person or family record
only.</p>
<p>An event has a type -- it can be a predefined one or you can use
&quot;Fact&quot; type as generic type and then add user-defined type
name. Also for any event you specify location where it took place, and
date or date range with calendar for the date(s). Optionally you can
add some text note, reference to sources and multimedia content. For
some events like death it is not unreasonable to specify a reason
caused the event and a certified organization.</p>
<p>&quot;Value&quot; field are valid only for events of type
&quot;Fact&quot;. For example, &quot;Value&quot; field for
&quot;Rank&quot; fact may store rank a person had while was doing
his/her military service. For &quot;Award&quot; it may store kind of
the award. GEDKeeper stores all values you have entered as facts&#39;
&quot;Values&quot;, thus you can quickly access the previous values
from the dropdown list.</p>

dates in <a href="gkhDateSpecials.html">Dates special features</a>
