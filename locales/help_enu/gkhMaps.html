<h1>Maps</h1>
<p>GEDKeeper uses Google Maps (&copy; Google) to show maps.</p>
<p>Using maps service GEDKeeper shows you locations of births, deaths
and living, defined in database, right on a map. There two modes
available: one shows births, deaths or living location for all persons
in database; another one shows all locations of any event for selected
person.</p>
<p>Before you will call the map service, you can filter persons out
using general GEDKeeper filters.</p>
