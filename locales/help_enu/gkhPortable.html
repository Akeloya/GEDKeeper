<h1>Portable application</h1>

<p>A portable application, is a program designed to read and write its 
configuration settings into an accessible folder in the computer, usually 
the folder where the portable application can be found. This makes it easier 
to transfer the program with the user's preferences and data between different computers.</p>

<p>First method: to make GEDKeeper portable just create folder `appdata` 
(for Windows) in the directory where GEDKeeper2.exe is located.</p>

<p>Second method: the `GEDKeeper' has the `-homedir:path` command-line option which, 
for example, stores the application's configuration files. User may define a 
relative directory, if he/she wants to specify "the current directory" (the 
current for environment or for GEDKeeper binary, etc). If the option is not 
used, the "home directory" defaults to system dependent path (like `%APPDATA%\GEDKeeper2`).</p>

<p>In the case that the subfolder `appdata` is in the program start folder and 
the command line argument` -homedir:path` is given - the priority for the command 
line argument and the subfolder will be ignored.</p>
