<h1>Tools: database check</h1>
<p>This tool checks information correctness in database. It checks two
types of records: family and person. Unlike usual database integrity
checking, which is run every time you are opening database and checks
only database itself, this tool handles logical errors or data
inaccuracy.</p>
<p>To pass the check, a family record must have assigned husband, wife,
children and events. When an empty family was found, the tool proposes
to remove it. It is normal in usual practice to create a family from
people, which, as it will be discovered later, are from different
families and were added erroneously. In these cases, GEDKeeper can easy
move men from one family to another. After such actions a family record
may lose all relations. This is very likely situation when you actively
process large amount of information.</p>
<p>A person record is checked in the following way: the tool checks
death event, taking the maximal, scientifically confirmed age  into
account, checks and notifies about people without explicitly defined
sex, notifies about incorrect lifetime dates (for example, death date
is before birthday), notifies about persons, that were married before
or after reasonable limits, or that have children, were born out of
reasonable limits (and because everything may happen, the tool just
notifies). When a man has no sex, the tool marks the record as being
changed and opens sex editor dialog. When a person&#39;s age exceeds
the maximum one, the tool adds death event without specified date to the
person record.</p>
<p>GEDKeeper fixes lack of death event and sex only, and also may
remove empty family records. All other issues are shown only for your
information.</p>
