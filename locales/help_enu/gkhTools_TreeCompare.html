<h1>Tools: databases compare</h1>
<p>There are two types of comparison available: internal comparison and
compare with other database.</p>
<p>Internal comparison just searches possible duplicates of person
records. There are some criteria to find similar or identical men. It
is worth noting that this compare sometimes gives false positive,
especially in cases of past centuries, when two or more children of
single family had the same name. That is, GEDKeeper explicitly does not
filter out brothers and sisters with the same name.</p>
<p>Database compare checks person records of two different databases.
The comparison shows equal family names and men with equal full names
from the both databases in dedicated lists. For your information and
further analysis, the lists show birthday and day of death for those
people. This compare is useful when you need to find perspective
matching in different databases.</p>
