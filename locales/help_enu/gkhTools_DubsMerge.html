<h1>Tools: merging duplicates</h1>
<p>This tool removes repetitions (duplicates) among persons in
database. The tool shows a prompting window to you, where you must
manually select (or give this choice to GEDKeeper) a record to remain
and a record to delete. When removed person has links, they may be
moved into remained person.</p>
<p>Merging duplicates tool also processes notes, families and
sources.</p>
<p>It is recommended to search duplicates with &quot;Check the year of birth&quot; option turned on (&quot;Options&quot; tab). This reduces
number of false operations.</p>
