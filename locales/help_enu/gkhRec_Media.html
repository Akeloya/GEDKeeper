<h1>Multimedia record</h1>

records.</p>

database: store as direct link to file, store as archive and store in
&quot;storage&quot;. Please read <a href="gkhMediaStore.html">Files
storing</a> article to get additional information.</p>
<p>Multimedia records found united directory for entire digitized
multimedia content available for user. Any time you can access this
directory and view required file. Photos, as a type of multimedia
record, can be used as portrait for a person record.</p>
<p>There is one crucial point when you are adding new multimedia record
to database: use any external file carefully. You should not add files
with size more than 10 MiB using &quot;In archive&quot; storage type.
Usually such large files are audio or video content with very poor
compression rate. This all increases size of database dramatically. It
is recommended to store large content either as link to external file
or as &quot;storage&quot; -- special file directory locating in the
same folder with database.</p>
