<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>There are three principal factor lying in the base of Genealogy:</p>
<ol>
<li>A man's name (who?)</li>
<li>Location, where an event occurred (where?)</li>
<li>Date of an event (when?)</li>
</ol> 
<p>Using GEDKeeper you can process huge amount of genealogical data.
The main property here is that GEDKeeper honors that three main
factors. For example, one can quickly find all namesakes, or all men
from the same village, or everyone who lived in a specific period of
time. User can filter data using all the three factors. For example, to
select namesakes, who lived in the same village in the specified
year.</p>
<p>User collects information (create database) using different sources
(including archives of all kinds). The following are two main sources:
Audit tales (audits and censuses made on more earlier or later time)
and registers of births. Other sources are also possible, but we take
the two sources as a basic.</p>
<p>A database filled with entries from sources, may be counted as
conditionally complete one. For example, we got data defining all
citizens of a specific locality at a specific period of time, if we had
used audits (censuses). Later we were adding more and more new
information, and finally we got a huge data array with many people
living in several locations during different time. Such database is
very useful for a genealogist, because no one knows about relations
between men in the database beforehand. This becomes more obviously
later, after inspecting other sources, for example, registers of
births.</p>
<p>Why is database called conditionally complete? Because it does not
contain strictly accurate data. Many data are approximate, or even
estimated. For example, a date in database can be exact
(1&nbsp;954/06/12), or much less exact (1&nbsp;954), or approximate
(around 1&nbsp;976), or estimated (before 1&nbsp;956 or after
1&nbsp;873). It is very important for a software to handle such dates
correctly.</p>
<p>GEDKeeper has a very efficient tool -- &quot;Timeline&quot;. This
tool can make time samples for events. Using &quot;Timeline&quot; one
can get a model of the original source -- an archival document. For
example, after we have made a time sample for 1&nbsp;858 using
locations of events, we can get a list similar to the original source
-- people who lived in a specific village in 1&nbsp;858 (as in tenth
audit of 1&nbsp;858). This allows us to check correction of all the
data we have added to database.</p>
