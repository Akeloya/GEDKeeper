<h1>Time line</h1>
<p>Time line is a visual tool for database filtering. When you move its
slider, that defines a year, list of persons shows only people who
lived in that year. In this mode &quot;Age&quot; column shows age
calculated relatively to that year.</p>
<p>Time line is useful on data analysis and source processing -- you
can view only people who lived in an affected year. You can combine
time line filtering and general person filtering by locations and
names.</p>
