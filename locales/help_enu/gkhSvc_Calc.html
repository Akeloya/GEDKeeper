<h1>Calculator</h1>
<p>GEDKeeper has an easy-to-use calculator, that allows you to evaluate
expression using general mathematical operations and temporary
variables.</p>
<p>Such calculator is very useful when you need to process bulk
information sources, for example, audit tales or confessional books.
You can work with the calculator and other windows simultaneously.
Therefore, for example, you can drag calculation result and drop it
into a date field inside event editor dialog. Thus, while you are
processing a source, you can enter &quot;1896-56&quot; expression in to
the calculator (a year in a source &quot;-&quot; person age
&quot;=&quot; year of birth), and then drag the result into a date
field (result is treated as year).</p>
