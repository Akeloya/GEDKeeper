<h1>Record selection dialog</h1>
<p>Record selection dialog appears in many places through the
application. Every time you need to add or select one record to&#47;for
another you will see this dialog. Record selection dialog has three
main functions: select a record having specific type, filter entries by
part of their names and add required record, if one does not exist.</p>
<p>When the dialog appears it contains list of records depending on
record type. When you add new person record for a parent or child, the
dialog shows you all persons available in database. When you attach
archive to source, record selection dialog contains archive list. When
you add location for event, the dialog shows you all available
locations.</p>
<p>For example, record selection dialog appears when you edit a person
and you need to add a parent to this person. First of all, it is
assumed that the parent has been added already and you should try to
find it using filters. When you are sure that the parent person is
missing in database, you can click &quot;Add&quot; button
immediately.</p>
