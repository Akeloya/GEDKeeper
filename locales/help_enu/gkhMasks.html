<h1>Filter masks</h1>
<p>You use masks in GEDKeeper to select persons, events or locations
having specific name. Text of a mask consists of general printable
characters, allowed for object names, and two special symbols
&#39;*&#39; and &#39;?&#39;.</p>
<p><em>Mask</em> name is used because &#39;*&#39; and &#39;?&#39;
symbols mask some arbitrary parts of a value.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#39;*&#39; inside a pattern matches any number of any characters;</li>
<li>&#39;?&#39; matches one any character.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to specify several different masks, you can use
&quot;|&quot; symbol to delimit each mask. For example, to get all
persons with names Mitch and John you can use &quot;*Mitch*|*John*&quot;
mask. &quot;|&quot; symbol acts as &quot;OR&quot; conjunction,
therefore any person whose name matches one of the masks, matches
entire &quot;Mitch*|John*&quot; mask.</p>
<p>Any person's name, event or location always matches &#39;*&#39;
mask. When you use such mask in a filter, it will show all objects.</p>
<p>When you need to get all persons with &quot;Ivanovs&quot; as last
name, you use &quot;Ivanov*&quot; masks in &quot;Name mask&quot; filter.
Star symbol matches any characters after initial substring
&quot;Ivanov&quot;. This way you get all persons with Ivanov,
Ivanovskih and so on as their last name. If you want to filter out all
persons with &quot;Vasiliy&quot; first name, you should use &quot;*
Vasiliy *&quot; pattern; thus you are masking any last name and
surname. To get all women with Vasilevna surname you use &quot;*
Vasilevna&quot;, masking any first name and last name.</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
- Names &quot;Litvin Ivan Andreevich&quot; and &quot;Semenov Ivan
Andreevich&quot; can be filtered out with &quot;*Ivan Andreevich&quot;
mask;<br />
- Any person with first name, last name or surname having
&quot;Ivan&quot; inside, matches &quot;*Ivan*&quot; mask;<br />
- Any woman with &quot;Natal<strong>i</strong>a&quot; or
&quot;Natal<strong>y</strong>a&quot; name matches &quot;Natal?a*&quot;
pattern.
