<h1>Source record</h1>
<p>A source is a mentioning any private document or file from archive
fund, where you found some information about persons. Source records
are used for the following purposes: they store specific information
about information&#39;s origin, unite and simplify search for person,
family and event, that were mentioned in one document.</p>
<p>This can be a birth or death certificate, audit tale, register of
births, confessional book and other documents.</p>
<p>Each <a href="gkhRec_SrcLink.html">source reference</a> has two
additional properties: page or sheet number, where the mentioning was
made, and authenticity level for the information. Having page or sheet
number is helpful when you need to review the source once again.
Authenticity level quickly shows you how much you can trust a source of
a particular information. When a source document has blots, damages and
you could not have read text with assurance, you should assign
&quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; level to such source.
This can prevent you from false conclusions.</p>
<p>Authenticity level also affects authenticity index, which is
calculated for a person in <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a>
module to analyze mean values. <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">Tree
diagrams</a> use authenticity level to make shown information more
obvious.</p>
<p>Source also has <a href="gkhRec_Repo.html">archive</a> property that
defines where the source is stored. It is worth noting that archive
here is not necessary a state archive or private archive institution,
but it is also a private document collection or other specific document
storage.</p>

working window, which includes all sources available in database.
