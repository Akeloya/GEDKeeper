<h1>Pedigrees</h1>
<p>GEDKeeper has ability to generate pedigree for generations. There
are two pedigree schemes available: d&#39;Aboville&#39;s and
Konovalov&#39;s schemes. Both schemes make identical pedigrees with the
only difference in persons numbering.</p>
<p>d&#39;Aboville&#39;s scheme assigns #1 to the first man in the
first generation; the man&#39;s first descendant in the next generation
gets #1.1; grandson -- #1.1.1 and so on. This system is suitable when
one has started to create tree draft on paper -- it is easy to add
elements to any generation in the pedigree using d&#39;Aboville&#39;s
scheme.</p>
<p>Konovalov&#39;s scheme gives numbers like &quot;X-Y&quot; to all
people, where &quot;X&quot; is sequence number for a man in the
pedigree, and &quot;Y&quot; is number of the man&#39;s ancestor. This
system provides an easy navigation but it is hard enough to manage
Konovalov&#39;s scheme using paper medium -- adding new persons to
existing generations will be a tough task; numbering get broken, the
pedigree becomes a mess.</p>
<p>GEDKeeper sees no big differences between those two schemes and
allows you to create pedigrees using any of the schemes. Choosing a
scheme is based on user preferences (appearance of pedigree, and how to
view and manage pedigree).</p>
<p>To create a pedigree using one of the scheme described above, select
required entry in the person list, and find menu item with the scheme
name in &quot;Pedigree&quot; menu. Or you can use <img

the toolbar.</p>
<p>Pedigree is created as a PDF file with hyperlinks between persons
inside. The created file is opened by a program registered in your
system to open PDF files. Using such program, you may print the
pedigree.</p>
<p>You can find settings for pedigree generation in the
&quotOptions&quot dialog on the &quot;Pedigrees&quot; tab.</p>
<ul>
<li>When &quot;Include person attributes&quot; option is on, pedigree
includes person&#39;s life events.</li>
<li>When &quot;Include notes&quot; option is on, pedigree includes text
notes from person&#39;s biography.</li>
<li>When &quot;Include sources&quot; option is on, pedigree includes
source&#39;s number that references a person. There is the source list
at the bottom of pedigree.</li>
<li>&quot;Format&quot; option has two possible values:
&quot;Redundant&quot; and &quot;Conventional&quot;. This option
controls detail level for person description printed in pedigree.
Usually, you should prefer the conventional format, because the
redundant one may contain too much unnecessary information.</li>
</ul>
