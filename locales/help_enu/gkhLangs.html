<h1>Localization</h1>

<p>GEDKeeper has multilanguage support. You can use, for example,
Russian localization or another one at your option. You can change user
interface localization using &quot;Service\Options&quot; on the
&quot;Common&quot; tab. Interface language is changed immediately --
you do not have to restart the application.</p>

<p>Also you can contribute to the project by translating user interface into your native language. Just translate the 
most suitable for the user &quot;lng&quot; file from the &quot;locales&quot; project subdirectory and email the
translated file to author of GEDKeeper. After checking, your file will be included in the next GEDKeeper release.</p>
