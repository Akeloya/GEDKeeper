<h1>Storing multimedia content files</h1>
<p>There are three ways to store multimedia content within GEDKeeper:
store file in an original place and use absolute pathname as a
reference, use file &quot;storage&quot; (a directory) or use file
archive (ZIP). Every method has its own advantages and
disadvantages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using absolute pathname. When this method is applied, database
stores only pathname. When system reads this file, it is opened using
that pathname. Such file is completely independent from GEDKeeper's
database, but once you have moved the database to another system, it is
necessary to fix all broken pathnames.</li>
<li>Storing in archive. GEDKeeper creates ZIP-archive having the same
name as your database has, and sharing the same directory with the
database. Any multimedia file you have added to database, is moved into
this archive. This method has several advantages. One of which is
having single data storage for all files in the database. It is also
very easy to move such database to another system. You just need to
move database itself and ZIP archive of the same name. But you cannot
add large files (video, music and photos) into archive; it is
disallowed by GEDKeeper. Large files have very low compression rate,
that is why there is no sense to add such files into an archive.</li>
<li>Using &quot;storage&quot;. In this case GEDKeeper creates new
directory near your database file (in the same directory with database
filename). The new directory has the same name as your database
filename has. When you add a multimedia file to database, this file is
copied into this directory. Thus, you got a centralized files storage
linked to your database, which is very easy to be moved to another
system -- you just copy database file and sibling directory of the same
name. There are no limits and disadvantages in this method.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use any of the above methods freely.</p>
