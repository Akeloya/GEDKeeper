<h1>Authenticity index</h1>
<p>Authenticity index of information about person is a special indicator that can be evaluated for person entity only.</p>
<p>Each reference to a source in a person entity has specific authenticity level of mention that man in the source. Authenticity level can have the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unreliable acknowledgement or supposed data (authenticity is 25%),</li>
<li>Doubtful acknowledgement (authenticity is 50%),</li>
<li>Indirect evidences (authenticity is 75%),</li>
<li>Direct and primary evidences (authenticity is 100%).</li>
</ul>
<p>While you are researching and viewing some information, authenticity level shows to you how much you can trust that information. It is better to set &quot;Doubtful acknowledgement&quot; if a source document had blots, was damaged and could not be read with confidence. This can prevent you from false conclusions.</p>
<p>If a reference to a source has no authenticity level, such reference gets &quot;Unreliable acknowledgement or supposed data&quot; by default. Just because mentioning a person in document is the important acknowledgement by itself.</p>
<p>Authenticity index is evaluated automatically for each person basing on authenticity level (as the weighted arithmetic mean). You can view authenticity index
in <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a> module for analysis of mean values or in <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">tree diagrams</a> for pictorial presentation. The index is evaluated using all references to sources, specified
in both person entity and all materials and events.</p>
