<h1>Tips and tricks for advanced using</h1>
<h3>Data input</h3>
<p>If you need to add to database large amount of individuals from an
audit tale or a register of births, and you are sure that no one of the
added individuals already exists in your database, you should create a
source record first, and then use that source as person filter. After
you completed those steps, you can start to add new data. Each new
person will get the source automatically. It makes providing a correct
source for person more easily -- all you need is just add page numbers
and authenticity index for person reference in a source. If you add an
individual who already exists in your database, you have two possible
solutions: not to filtering the content, and use the merging duplicates
tool after you completed data entering.</p>
<p>There is a specialized plug-in provided with GEDKeeper --
&quot;Streamed data input&quot;, that allows add data from audit tales
and a register of births. Using this plug-in you enter data in format,
that is very close to one used in the sources. But remember that
currently this plug-in is an experiment; it is not supported and not
developed; we do not guarantee stable work of the plug-in.</p>
<p>Starting from version 2.3 GEDKeeper has image viewer plug-in. It
becomes useful when you need to simultaneously work with a photo or
scanned page of a document and database. To work this way, you need to
open a database, open image viewer plug-in and click
&quot;Windows&#47;Vertical tile&quot; menu item. After this, both
windows lay itself out to be very useful for you. The image viewer
plug-in is a very simple image viewer, but it has enough functions for
the mode of operation described above. You can zoom and pan image.
There is only one advantage of this plug-in over external third party
image viewer software: when you use GEDKeeper on a large monitor or on
a multi-monitor configuration, you do not have to switch between
applications or be careful not to press one of many hot-keys, used in
an external software, that can change the current image appearance.</p>
<p>When you process a source and know that your large database already
has person being processed, you can use &quot;Time line&quot; plug-in to
quickly find that person. After you moved &quot;slider&quot; to the
necessary year, you get list of individuals who was alive in this year.
When this technique is combined with location or name filters, you can
speed up data processing noticeably.</p>
<h3>Data processing</h3>
<p>When you continuously process large databases, you would like
&quot;Check family connectivity&quot; and &quot;Database check&quot;
tools. The former discovers data fragmentation: it shows all unrelated
groups of person records. Sometimes this reveals errors made at the
time of heavy work, when a person was disjoined from a family, but was
not attached to another one. Thus, such person remains
&quot;free&quot;. Database check discovers all errors or
inconsistencies in database. There are not so many criteria currently,
but, for example, this tool reveals erroneous years of birth in
families (when one of parents or their descendants have incorrect year
and age differences are less than a reasonable limit). Or, another
example, heavy work with sources frequently ends up with empty family
records. GEDKeeper does not remove such records automatically, but this
tool finds it and can remove the records from database.</p>
<h3>Tips and tricks for easy handling</h3>
<p>You can use <img src="images/iCopy.gif" align="absmiddle"> button in
person editor window to copy person&#39;s full name to the
clipboard.</p>
<p>Text fields for names in the first, small window for person adding,
can change case of the first letter in a name and remove leading and
trailing spaces in text. To use those function just press [ Ctrl + Down
] keys while you are in a text field.</p>
