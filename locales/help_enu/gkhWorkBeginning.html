<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>If you get started to work with GEDKeeper, you must create an empty
database first, by clicking <img src="images/iCreateNew.gif"
align="absmiddle"> button on the toolbar.</p>
<p>Using <img src="images/iRecNew.gif" align="absmiddle"> button create
new person record. It makes sense to create a person, that is a central
one for your family tree.</p>
<p>GEDKeeper splits adding new person onto two steps. The first one is
a small window for person adding.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/dlgPersonNew.gif"></p>
<p>The second step is a large person editor window. The creation
process got split on to the two stages to simplify adding diverse
information about person, which may affect huge number of database
records and relations. Had the creation process implemented with single
window object, it would be very hard to undo all changes made by user
in the window if user has cancelled creation (user might have added
bulk information about person, then user cancelled changes and here
GEDKeeper would had to remove already saved information from database).
But this problem goes away if two-steps creation is used.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/dlgPersonEdit.gif"></p>
<p>You can leave any field empty if you currently do not necessary
information. As time goes by, you add new data and relations, thus,
forming your family tree.</p>
<p>If you need to load already existed data (created by GEDKeeper or
other application compatible with GEDCOM specification), click
&quot;Open tree file&quot; <img src="images/iLoad.gif"
align="absmiddle"> button or click &quot;File&#47;Open...&quot; menu
item. After you have selected a file, GEDKeeper loads it and you can
start edit or process new data.</p>
