<h1>Options</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<h3>Files encoding</h3>
<p>GEDKeeper can save GEDCOM-database using two encodings:
ASCII&#47;ANSI and UTF-8.</p>
<p>ANSEL encoding is not supported because it is deprecated and it was
used mainly on USA region.</p>
<p>For better portability it is recommended to use <a target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">UTF-8</a> encoding. UTF-8
has very best support for national symbols and it is compatible with
Microsoft Windows and Linux platforms.</p>
<h3>Work mode</h3>
<p>There are two modes for working with parents&#39; families in person
modifying dialog: &quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;Advanced&quot;. In
simple mode you handle parents&#39; family as a whole object, i.e.
attach and detach the family as a whole. In advanced mode you can
attach and detach mother or father from the person individually.</p>
<p>Beginners should start with simple mode because novices frequently
make errors while they are modifying relations between parents and
children. They take this link as a direct one, and do not take family
itself into account, as a whole object used as real link between
parents and children.</p>
<h3>Use proxy when downloading from the Internet</h3>
<p>Set up these settings when you access the Internet via proxy.</p>
<h3>Prompts</h3>
<p>Currently promptings show only birthday reminding on the
application startup.</p>
<h3>User interface</h3>
<h3>Highlight person with no parents or family</h3>
<p>Highlighting persons with no parents or family improves navigation
through the list. The following color scheme is applied: white
background is used for persons with family and parents, flaxen
background -- for persons without family; light red -- for persons
without parents. Light colors do not prevent to get information.</p>
<a name="tree"><h2>Family tree</h2></a>
<p>There are two setting groups for family tree generation: how persons
are represented in the tree and how the tree appears on a render
target.</p>
<h3>Person representation in the tree</h3>
<p>Here you define what data you will see in the tree: last name, first
name and surname, birthday and obit, part of dates.</p>
<p>When &quot;Relation degree&quot; option is on, every person has
visible relation degree, that is calculated on each tree rebuild
relative to the central person in the tree.</p>
<p>&quot;Additional symbols&quot; shows special symbols for some
categories of people. There are special icons for veterans of the World
War II, died, veterans of Labor, cavalier of Cross of St. George,
repressed. These categories are defined in the <a
href="gkhRec_UserRefs.html">user-defined reference</a> section in
person editor.</p>
<p>&quot;Embellished appearance&quot; controls some additional
graphical elements and shadow.</p>
<p>&quotHide passed away in childhood&quot; option becomes helpful when
you handle several sources strongly, because it can reduce number of
visible persons and make your task much simpler.</p>
<h3>Appearance (color and font)</h3>
<p>This setting group defines colors and the main font used in tree
rendering.</p>
<a name="pedigree"><h2>Pedigrees</h2></a>
<p>Here you set up pedigree generation. &quot;Include person
attributes&quot; checks if person&#39;s life events will be included in
pedigree. &quot;Include notes&quot; option checks if text notes from
person&#39;s biography will be included in pedigree. &quot;Include
sources&quot; option checks if pedigree includes source&#39;s number
that references a person. There is the source list at the bottom of
pedigree. &quot;Format&quot; option, that has two possible values:
&quot;Redundant&quot; and &quot;Conventional&quot;, controls level of
details for person description printed in pedigree. Usually, you should
prefer the conventional format, because the redundant one may contain
too much unnecessary information.</p>
