<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>Common</h2>

<h3>Use proxy when downloading from the Internet</h3>

<p>Set up these settings when you access the Internet via a proxy.</p>

<h3>Show tips on startup</h3>

<p>Currently this shows birthday reminders on application startup.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<h3>Highlight person with no parents or family</h3>

<p>Highlighting persons with no parents or family improves navigation through the list. The following color scheme is 
applied: a white background is used for persons with family and parents, flaxen background for persons without family, and
light red for persons without parents. Background colors do not prevent getting information.</p>

<a name="tree"><h2>Family tree</h2></a>

<p>There are two setting groups for family tree generation: how persons are represented in the tree and how the tree 
appears on a render target.</p>

<h3>Person representation in the tree</h3>

<p>Here you define what data you will see in the tree: last name, first name and surname, birthday and obit, and what part of 
dates.</p>

<p>When the &quot;Kinship&quot; option is on, every person has a visible relation degree&#151;which is calculated on each 
tree rebuild relative to the central person in the tree.</p>

<p>&quot;Additional symbols&quot; shows special symbols for some categories of people. There are special icons for 
veterans of the World War II, died, veterans of Labor, cavalier of Cross of St. George, and repressed. These categories are 
defined in the <a href="gkhRec_UserRefs.html">user-defined reference</a> section in the person editor.</p>

<p>&quot;Tree decorative&quot; controls some additional graphical elements and shadows.</p>

<p>The &quot;Hide died in childhood&quot; option becomes helpful when you handle several sources, because it 
can reduce the number of visible persons and make your task much simpler.</p>

<h3>Decor (color and font)</h3>

<p>This setting group defines colors and the main font used in tree rendering.</p>

<a name="pedigree"><h2>Pedigrees</h2></a>

<p>Here you set up pedigree generation. &quot;Include attributes of individuals&quot; checks if a person&#39;s life events will be 
included in the pedigree. The &quot;Include notes&quot; option checks if text notes from a person&#39;s biography will be included 
in the pedigree. The &quot;Include sources&quot; option determines if the pedigree includes source numbers that reference a person&#151;there
is a source list at the bottom of the pedigree. The &quot;Format&quot; option has two possible values: 
&quot;Excess&quot; and &quot;Compact&quot;. These control the level of details for a person description printed in the pedigree. 
Usually, you would use the Compact format, because the Excess one may contain too much unnecessary 
information.</p>
