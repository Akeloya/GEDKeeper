<h1>Tools: check family connectivity</h1>
<p>This is an analysis tool -- you use it to check number of fully
interrelated families. The tool starts from a person and then processes
all persons that have any relation with the initial person,
irrespective of relation degree. All inspected persons are combined in
one group. All persons interrelated between each other, but not with
the first group, are combined in other groups.</p>
<p>You can develop several unrelated families in one database. This
tool gives you ability to visually manage their composition. Also, you
can use this tool as an integrity checking procedure, for example, for
cases when you removed a person from a family but did not add that
person to other family. In such cases, check family connectivity tool
shows the person as disjoint from all groups.</p>
<p>Double click on a person in group list to open this person in the
main working list of database. This may be helpful when you want to
make some changes.</p>
<p>There is database fragmentation diagram under the list of group
contents. For better visual perception the diagram has logarithmic
scale, therefore size of a piece is not directly proportional to number
of persons in the relative group. This decreases size of large
segments, but keeps small fragments clearly visible. Hovering mouse
over a fragment shows you fragment&#47;group number and its size.</p>
