<h1>Research record</h1>
<p>You use research records to manage research main directions and
priority of those directions. You create a research for some family
branch and assign relative priority for this research, then you track a
period of time when research is in progress, check the current research
status and completion state.</p>
<p>You can split research up into individual <a
href="gkhRec_Task.html">tasks</a>, add correspondence between and
communication with relatives or other researchers using <a
href="gkhRec_Comm.html">correspondence</a> record, add <a
href="gkhRec_Group.html">social groups</a> to easily find all people,
that were researched under this search direction.</p>
<p>You add description of search progress and required comments using
<a href="gkhRec_Note.html">text notes</a>.</p>
