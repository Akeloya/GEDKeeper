<h1>Tools: pedigrees import</h1>
<p>Attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import processes pedigrees in text format only.</li>
<li>Person must be identified by Konovalov&#39;s scheme.</li>
<li>Person identifier and its name must be delimited by period (for
example, &quot;2-1. Daniel Garner&quot;).</li>
<li>Name must have the following format:&quot;First_name
Patronymic_name Last_name&quot;.</li>
<li>Person sex is determined basing on typical features of Russian
language&#39;s woman names, on names reference index, and, in all other
cases, on user decision (via prompting).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>A recommendation:</b> make several import attempts and check
result after each attempt. If you find an error, modify the origin
text. For example, frequently birthdays inside a row with name are not
marked with &quot;*&quot; symbol. It is impossible to recognize such
situations intelligently, because this will increase number of false
positives. Moreover, name may contain name variants enclosed in
parentheses, without parentheses or with &quot;?&quot; mark. It is
impossible to recognize these with a simple enough algorithm. It is
better to extract such data, and various date formats, to a text block
after the row with name.</p>
