<h1>Tools: search for patriarchs</h1>
<p>This tool searches the most remote ancestor in each investigated
family tree. GEDKeeper searches through different families in database
and chooses a male from each family, that has no parents and has
specified number of descendant generations. When an ancestor has
unspecified year of birth, this year is evaluated automatically, basing
on year of birth of the closest descendants. Such rough calculations are
made for evaluation only. For each patriarch GEDKeeper calculates both
number of generations and number of descendants.</p>
<p>Before you begin to work with this search, you must define length of
a target family branch. For example, if you need all patriarchs that
have at least three descendant generations, enter this number in
&quot;Generations of not less than&quot; field. Then press
&quot;Search&quot; button. The search will find all matching
patriarchs.</p>
<p>&quot;Ignore dates&quot; option forces GEDKeeper to not to calculate
birthday of a patriarch. In this case, patriarch without defined
birthday will have &quot;-1&quot; as year of birth.</p>
<p>Person with &quot;patriarch label&quot; has [*] sign before its name
(see <a href="gkhNav_Labels.html">Label for an individual
record</a>).</p>
<p>You can use &quot;Assign the sign&quot; to set &quot;patriarch
label&quot; and stay in the current tool, not changing it to person
editor window.</p>
<p>&quot;Diagram&quot; button shows so called &quot;Graph of
interconnections between patriarchs&quot;. This diagram is a specific
tool and it may appear too complicated at first glance. To reduce
number of vertices in the graph, we recommend you to set large enough
number of patriarch&#39;s descendant generations before you are about
to view the diagram. After the diagram has been built and stabilized,
you can see patriarchs on the diagram as dark-blue vertices and
intersections of their descendants&#39; branches as lilac vertices.
Digital signature on a node is a family identifier. Hovering mouse over
a vertex shows name of family in this node. Arrows are directed from
ancestor&#39;s family to descendant&#39;s one, where two kins
intersect.</p>
