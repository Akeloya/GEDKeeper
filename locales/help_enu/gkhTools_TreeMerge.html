<h1>Tools: databases merger</h1>
<p>This tool currently directly merges one database to another one. All
records from one database are copied to another database. Records are
not modified, and not merged. No relations are modified too.</p>
<p>It is good to run search duplicates tool after you have run this
one. Especially when both databases have information about the same
persons.</p>
