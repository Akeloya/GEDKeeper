<h1>Advantages and features</h1>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>GEDKeeper is freeware, open-source and has no ads.</li>
<li>GEDKeeper supports both Linux and Windows. It is a cross-platform project; one can build release on Linux or Windows operating systems.</li>
<li>It doesn’t limit data size.</li>
<li>Main functions are always been improving, kernel is continuously developed and get tested. We always seek for new ways to improve program reliability and performance.</li>
<li>Wholesome conservatism at user interface – author does not change GUI from version to version each time, following all new trends blindly.</li>
<li>GEDKeeper can be easily extended: it supports scripts and plug-ins. Any user aware of programming in VB.NET or C# can create its own plug-in.</li>
<li>GEDKeeper supports several localizations. Any user can create localization for the program for his&#47;her native language.</li>
<li>Author emphasizes maximum improvement of navigation and search over information in very big data arrays of genealogical information (filtering, search and navigation).</li>
<li>GEDKeeper does not integrate with genealogical social networks or databases and never forces users to save their data to such storages (author is an advocate of local only and private data storing, because he is sure that once user uploads its data on the Internet, this data is not a property of the user anymore).</li>
<li>GEDKeeper guarantees data safety and integrity in case of possible system errors.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Some users may consider some advantages from above as big disadvantages. Well, everyone has its own preferences and there is many other genealogical software that can meet that preferences with beautiful and stylish implementations.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages when compared with other open-source, non-profit and commercial software</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>For a long time GEDKeeper had poor help content (this document). The primary reason for this is that author was never promoting the program.
Thus, GEDKeeper has few users which give insufficient material for updated help content.</li>
<li>There is no good Internet site for GEDKeeper presentation.</li>
<li>We are slowly elaborating import of GEDCOM files generated by a third party software. But there is one good news: GEDKeeper handles foreign GEDCOM data
(data made by other software products) very carefully and never loses unknown data structures. Therefore, while some data may not be shown, they are always
saved as is (see &quot;Features&quot; section below).</li>
<li>There were many claims that GEDKeeper is not flexible, is not
beautiful enough and has too few types of tree diagrams. But those
claims vanish away once you have got ideology of GEDKeeper: be a
laconic tool for gathering, processing and searching information while
performing long and broad genealogical research (author, for example,
has more than 70 research branches in its own database used to
investigate all possible relatives). Having such approach most third
party solutions for trees visualizing give nothing for effective
processing, although there are very nice and beautiful diagrams among
such solutions. On the other hand, author and other users work with all
the diagrams, implemented in GEDKeeper, permanently and they totally
satisfy their requirements in efficient and clear way of work.
Moreover, author always welcome any user who wants to create an add-on
that implements other types of diagram.</li>
<li>GEDKeeper has poor support for various multimedia content. It cannot play audio or video, or bring a slide show to you <em>using its own facilities</em>.
GEDKeeper can view any media content, but when it needs to play audio or video it resorts to the help of system’s players.</li>
<li>GEDKeeper cannot print a document. Just because we want to give to
a user ability to get full control over handling pictures of trees and
pedigrees. It is assumed that user will save tree as a picture or
pedigree as a PDF file, and then user will use third party software to
print the exported content.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>GEDKeeper almost completely meets requirements of GEDCOM
specification v5.5.1. Including non-standard European extension for
storing notes and references to geographical locations with
coordinates.</li>
<li>GEDKeeper itself adds non-standard extensions to GEDCOM
specification to store and process social groups, researches, tasks and
correspondence. Most genealogical software has such extensions but
unfortunately they are all non-standard. There were repeated attempts
undertaken in the past to develop new GEDCOM specification included
these extensions, but all attempts failed.</li>
<li>GEDKeeper cannot save its database as file that meets pure GEDCOM
specification only, without extensions. But no one has required such
feature during GEDKeeper&#39;s lifetime.</li>
<li>GEDKeeper primarily targets Russian users, therefore, some
functions, for example, one that handles names, are not flexible enough
and could not meet requirements of non-Russian users.</li>
<li>Currently GEDKeeper does not store data in a relational database.
Experiments made by author revealed that with databases having less
than 500&nbsp;000 person records, relational database does not give any
benefits neither in performance nor in usability if compared to the
currently implemented data storing. Having many related questions, it is necessary
to emphasize that this software will never support storing data in
commercial relational databases, like desktop MSFT Access or
client-server Oracle, Sybase or MS SQL Server. Even if a relational
database will become a necessity only freeware products may be chosen,
like SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird and, may be, - Berkeley
DB.</li>
<li>GEDCOM specification defines two equivalent ways to store internal
references to media content, notes and sources: local storage in form of event
object and as full-fledged record, peered to other types of records
like persons and families. GEDKeeper uses only the latter, and converts
on the fly any GEDCOM file when opens a file came from an external
source. This allows instantly make all notes, media content and sources
available for viewing and navigation, and see what records reference to
those objects.</li>
