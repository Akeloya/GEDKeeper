<h1>Tools: database splitting</h1>
<p>Usually, you split your database when you need to completely remove
some persons or families from the database, or you need to make a copy
of those persons or families to move data to another database, or you
need to send them to other researchers.</p>
<p>Before you run this tool, you must select a person you want to copy
in person list on &quot;Persons&quot; tab. Then you use one of four
available methods in this tool: pick out all relations, pick out
ancestors only, pick out descendants only or family only. When all
persons have been picked out, you can save them as a separate database
file, or remove them all from the current database (you can combine
these operations, that is save picked result as database at first, and
then remove it from the current database).</p>
<p>There are two lists in user interface of this tool: a list on the
left contains all picked persons, a list one the right contains persons
that were not picked by the tool.</p>
