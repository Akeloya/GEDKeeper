<h1>A link to source</h1>
<p>A link to source is a specialized link valid only for person, family
and event records, that binds a concrete <a
href="gkhRec_Source.html">information source</a>. A link to source has
two additional properties: page or sheet number, where the mentioning
was made, and authenticity level for the information. Having page or
sheet number is helpful when you need to review the source once again.
Authenticity level quickly shows you how much you can trust a source of
a particular information. When a source document has blots, damages and
you could not have read text with assurance, you should assign
&quot;Questionable reliability of evidence&quot; level to such source.
This can prevent you from false conclusions.</p>
<p>Authenticity level also affects <a
href="gkhCAIndex.html">authenticity index</a>, which is calculated for
a person in <a href="gkhStats.html">statistics</a> module to analyze
mean values. <a href="gkhTreeChart.html">Tree diagrams</a> use
authenticity level to make shown information more obvious.</p>
