<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<dl>
<dt>1. Can I have thousands of persons in my database?</dt>
<dd>There is no limit for number of records in program&#39;s database. May be in the future big database size (about ten thousand records) will hit program performance. But this will be fixed in the next releases.</dd>
<dt>2. Can I add source references to each person, family and case?</dt>
<dd>You have no limits when attaching source references to person, family and other objects, including all events and cases. All references to sources may be grouped by archives.</dd>
<dt>3. I need to record data about unrelated persons, which lived in a single village and were at most relative of each other in the past, but this was not revealed quickly. Can I do this with GEDKeeper?</dt>
<dd>The program has no limits for storing unrelated persons. Moreover, having unrelated persons in database was an initial program requirement.</dd>
<dt>4. Can I print or export data from GEDKeeper to some commonly used formats?</dt>
<dd>There are following options available for data exporting:
<p>a) Three types of trees: ascending and descending relationship, combined. Other types are not yet implemented currently, but can be added later while number of requests increases. GEDKeeper cannot print trees itself, but you can export a tree to JPG or WMF graphics file and print such file from an external application.</p>
<p>b) Export list of person to Excel workbook. Currently there are no many settings for export tuning and selecting exported information, but this will evolve as needed.</p>
<p>c) Export persons’ statistical data with cataloging, in several Web-formats.</p>
<p>d) Create pedigrees having two schemes of numbering:
d&#39;Aboville&#39;s and Konovalov&#39;s schemes. Such pedigrees are
created as HTML, RTF or PDF files and you can use any third party
viewer, installed in your system (for example, <a
href="https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf"
target="_blank">SumatraPDF</a> or Adobe Reader) to print such files.
Generated files have hyperlinks for main directions. Optionally you can
add references to sources and notes into the generated files.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, PDF export currently is available on Windows
platforms only. PDF export on Linux currently is under heavily
development.</p>
<p>e) Create Google-maps with marks for places of birth, death, living of all persons in database or of a single selected person. Printing may be implemented in the future.</p>
</dd>
<dt>5. Can I import data from other application using GEDCOM format?</dt>
<dd>Yes, import GEDCOM-formatted data is fully supported. GEDCOM is native data format for GEDKeeper. GEDKeeper uses some extensions of the format, but all of them meet requirements for GEDCOM extensions. Therefore, you can also export data from GEDKeeper to other software supporting GEDCOM. We sometimes check such compatibility. Here is the list of out extensions: groups for quick and vivid joining unrelated persons, objects: &quot;research&quot;, &quot;task&quot; and &quot;communication&quot; (to store correspondence archive, creating and tracking tasks and researches).</dd>
<dt>6. How to create list or persons grouped by one of properties: sex, age, place or social status, define in a source?</dt>
<dd>To create such lists you can use one of the following methods:
<p>a) Sort a list by clicking a column header. Ascending or descending order sorting is implemented in all lists in the program, including age, sex and
place of residence columns.</p>
<p>b) Sort on an individual part of name. In order to use this, you have to split one full name column to three parted columns. Go to &quot;Edit\Options...&quot;
and change how a name is shown in list to split on individual component.</p>
<p>c) Filter content. You can use filter on the following object properties: sex, live&#47;died attribute, &quot;patriarch&quot; attribute, logical group of people, name and
place of residence. When filtering by name and place you can use special meta-characters to search by &quot;mask&quot;: &#39;*&#39; symbol matches any number of any characters,
&#39;?&#39; symbol matches any single character. In such a way &quot;Sm*&quot; filter matches any name starting with &quot;Sm&quot;, &quot;*sm*&quot; matches any name having &quot;sm&quot; inside the name.
You can define compound filter using &quot;OR&quot; conjunction, for example: &quot;*jo*|*sm*&quot; matches any name with &quot;jo&quot; or &quot;sm&quot; inside the name.</p>
<p>d) Use groups. You can sort by a group, apply filter by a group and view a group’s members when you have selected the group in its native list.
This is one of the most flexible and advanced navigation, because one person can have several social or other groups.</p>
</dd>
<dt>7. Can GEDKeeper shows empty dates on death and birth events as &quot;?&quot; in lists?</dt>
<dd>Currently this is not implemented. But may be implemented in the future as an optional feature. Numerous tests revealed that such behavior clutters main lists up.
If we will get enough number of requests for this feature, we will implement it.</dd>
<dt>8. Can you improve new persons adding feature by implementing &quot;Apply and continue&quot; button?</dt>
<dd>Similar feature is implemented by the plug-in that can be accessed via &quot;Plug-ins\Continuous data adding&quot; menu. This plug-in gives ability to add minimal
information about a person while you need to handle big number of persons. You enter only some main information and put aside adding information about
relationships and other secondary data.</dd>
