<h1>File encryption</h1>
<p>GEDKeeper supports storing and loading encrypted GEDCOM files. The
standard does not support encryption, therefore GEDKeeper chose its own
implementation for file encryption.</p>
<p>When you are saving a database, you must choose &quot;GEDKeeper
encrypted GEDCOM files (*.geds)&quot; as target file format. Files of
this format have &quot;.geds&quot; extension. After you have selected
the file format and entered file name, you are prompted to enter
password. When you are about to load an encrypted file, you select the
same file format and enter your password when you will be prompted.</p>
<p>Attention: GEDKeeper uses not the most cryptographically secure
encryption method through existed ones. But following &quot;security
best practices&quot; it does not store a password within an encrypted
file. Therefore, if you will forget or lose your password once, nobody
(including GEDKeeper author) will be able to open your database file.
Be careful and enter your password cautiously. Any symbol inadvertently
added can be a cause for losing your file.</p>
<p>Currently GEDKeeper uses &quot;DES&quot; algorithm for encryption
and &quot;SHA1&quot; for signing. In case of need a better cryptography
service may be used (for example, &quot;3DES&quot; or
&quot;AES&quot;).</p>
<p>Also, the following features are delayed for future development:
choosing encryption method by user, prompting for password only once
for the same file, adding password repeat field when a file is saved at
first time (to avoid typos in password text).</p>
