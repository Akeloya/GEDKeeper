<h1>Family tree</h1>
<p>There are three types of tree diagrams GEDKeeper can create: tree of
ancestors (ascending relationship tree), tree of descendants
(descending relationship tree) and combined tree -- tree of ancestors
and descendants. You can set up diagram appearance in
&quot;Options&quot; dialog on &quot;<a
href="gkhOptions.html#tree">Tree</a>&quot; tab (you can get an access
to &quot;Options&quot; dialog via &quot;Edit&#47;Options...&quot; menu
item). You can change information to show about persons and change
colors of tree elements.</p>
<p>To build a tree, you pick a person out in person list, then choose a
tree type (ancestors, descendants or complete) in &quot;Pedigree&quot;
menu. Also you can use the following main window&#39;s toolbar&#39;s
buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="images/iTreeAncestry.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;Tree of
ancestors</li>
<li><img src="images/iTreeDescendants.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;Tree
of descendants</li>
<li><img src="images/iTreeBoth.gif" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;Complete
tree</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have created a tree, you can use <img
src="images/iSaveImage.gif" align="absmiddle"> button to export the
tree in one of the following formats: raster format (BMP, JPEG, PNG or
GIF) or vector one (EMF). Not every family tree may be saved as a
bitmap file, because the latter may not store more than 65k pixels per
horizontal line. Vector file does not have such restriction; therefore,
it can store trees of any size. Moreover, having a vector file is
better for the next image processing in graphical applications and
printing.</p>
<p>The following controls are available when you view a diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>vertical scrolling with mouse wheel;</li>
<li>horizontal scrolling with mouse wheel and holding <kbd>[ Shift
]</kbd> key;</li>
<li>zoom with mouse wheel and holding <kbd>[ Ctrl ]</kbd> key;</li>
<li>zoom with scale control at top right corner of the window;</li>
<li><kbd>[ F5 ]</kbd> key rebuilds the tree;</li>
<li><kbd>[ F6 ]</kbd> key marks the currently selected person as a
starting point and updates all ancestors and descendants of the
starting point;</li>
<li><kbd>[ F7 ]</kbd> key recalculates relation degrees (if they are
turned on) of the currently selected person;</li>
<li>double click on a person to open it in edit mode;</li>
<li>click on a person to adjust it with window&#39;s center;</li>
<li>pan the content while mouse&#39;s right button is held;</li>
<li>click on <img src="images/iExpand.gif" align="absmiddle"> icon
(&quot;there are additional hidden data&quot;) near a person to rebuild
the tree relatively to that person (this icon is not exported to image
file).</li>
</ul>
<p>Number of visible generations (of both ancestors and descendants)
can be adjusted from one to nine (+ with no limits) by the button with
drop down menu on the window&#39;s toolbar.</p>
<p>Also you can filter content out with <img src="images/iFilter.gif"
align="absmiddle"> button.</p>
<p>If you have used [ F6 ] key or <img src="images/iExpand.gif"
align="absmiddle"> icon (set new person as a central one for the tree),
you can use <img src="images/iLeft1.gif" align="absmiddle"> and <img
src="images/iRight1.gif" align="absmiddle"> buttons to return to the
previous or next person.</p>
<p><img src="images/iTools.gif" align="absmiddle"> shows the following
tree options:</p>
<ul>
<li>All -- show both ancestors and descendants for a specified
person;</li>
<li>Ancestors only -- only ancestors of the selected person are
visible;</li>
<li>Descendants only -- only descendants of the selected person are
visible;</li>
<li>Center auto-change -- turn off/on a mode when center of the tree is
smoothly adjusted with the selected person;</li>
<li>Authenticity index -- turn off/on authenticity index visibility for
each person in the tree (it is handy for visual evaluation of
development progress);</li>
<li>Background color -- change background color for this tree;</li>
<li>Background image -- change background image for this tree.</li>
</ul>
