<h1>Person record</h1>
<p>Person record is the most important record type in a genealogical
database. Such record contains all information about a man. GEDKeeper
allows you to store full name, nickname and sex in a person record. You
can list all events and facts that relate to the person&#39;s life.
Using GEDKeeper you easily investigate family and social relations of
the person (associations with other people). GEDKeeper never restrict
you in number of person&#39;s families and children. Also you can
divide people by different social groups, add additional indicators to
improve obviousness (references and footnotes), add unlimited number of
notes, multimedia materials and sources, and add person&#39;s portraits
to show them in trees.</p>
<p>This is the list of dialog&#39;s tabs and respective data categories
you can change:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="gkhRec_Event.html">Event</a> represents an event or fact
from person&#39;s life;</li>
<li><a href="gkhRec_Family.html">Family</a> lists marriages of person
or family relations; common children are specified in the dedicated
dialog;</li>
<li><a href="gkhRec_Asso.html">Association</a> lists person&#39;s
social relations;</li>
<li><a href="gkhRec_Group.html">Group</a> is a way to unite objects by
social relations, which makes navigation and search more effective;</li>
<li><a href="gkhRec_Note.html">Note</a> is an arbitrary text about
person;</li>
<li><a href="gkhRec_Media.html">Multimedia content</a> combines photos,
scanned documents and portraits;</li>
<li><a href="gkhRec_Source.html">Source</a> represents used documents,
correspondences and other kinds of source of information about
person;</li>
<li><a href="gkhRec_UserRefs.html">Reference&#47;footnote</a> is an
additional indicator for GEDKeeper itself or a way to create handy
classification.</li>
</ul>
<p>GEDKeeper splits new person creation process on to the two phases:
adding and changing details. The first stage is a small dialog for
adding new person.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/dlgPersonNew.gif"></p>
<p>But the second stage is a big dialog where you change person
detailed information. The creation process get split on to the two
stages to simplify adding diverse information about person, which may
affect huge number of database records and relations. Had the creation
process implemented with single window object, it would be very hard to
undo all changes made by user in the window if user has cancelled
creation (user might have added bulk information about person, then
user cancelled changes and here GEDKeeper would had to remove already
saved information from database). But this problem goes away if
two-steps creation is used.</p>

<ul>
<li>You change person&#39;s parents using special dedicated panel with
two fields -- for person&#39;s father and mother, and three groups of
buttons. At first glance this looks too complex, but in action this

person, you use a specific tab and the following standard buttons: <img

of events to the affected person, that are related to his/her life,

you add or change one of conjoints, family editor window appears. Using
that window you do what you need: add a spouse, children or event.

working window, which includes all persons available in database.
