** How to build GEDKeeper **
****************************

Microsoft Windows
    Dependencies
        Building
            - Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0.30319
            - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later

        Testing
            - NUnit 2.6.4 (unit testing framework for .NET)

        Packaging
            - 7-zip
            - Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) 3.04

    Execution
        Run the executable "build_all_mswin.x86.cmd" from the command line.

        Optionally pass the "release" option to the script to build without
        debugging information. By default the script builds the executable with
        embedded debugging information. The script skips testing for non-debug
        builds.

Linux
    Sorry, not yet implemented.

    Make it!
